In last blog I talked about How I get into the Open-source and way to my first PR. If you are familiar with Open-source then I am pretty much sure that you must have heard word [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)(Google Summer of Code). In this blog I am going to share my experience till selected as GSoC 2024 contributor at Stdlib.

# Progress Till Now

Since, I have set up project locally now it is easier for me to contribute to Stdlib. Within the span of 2-3 days I have opened more than 5 PRs which were later merged into main project in the same week. After that I got involved into chat with the [Athan Reines](https://www.linkedin.com/in/athanreines/) and I got to know about the some pending tasks which should be done. After a fruitful discussion I decided to work on project **Add Prototype method for Complex Number Array** which includes adding documentation, benchmarks and unit tests for the same. I started working on same and opened bunch of PR for the same. After contributed to project for good amount of time, me and Athan had a meet in which he described about workflows and history about project.

# Path to GSoC 2024

Google started accepting organization application from 22nd Jan, 2024 and our organization have applied for the GSoC 2024. After few days Google announced list of accepted mentoring organizations on 22nd Feb, 2024. And guess what Stdlib is one among the selected organizations. It was a quite memorable day for Stdlib since, last year they have faced rejection for the same.

Now, I need to figure out which project I should take for the Google Summer of Code application. Around 2-3 times I had chat with Athan for selecting project which perfectly suits my previous work regarding complex number array. After considering every aspect of the project, I finally decide to go with the project **Add support for Boolean arrays in Stdlib**. As the name suggest, I need to enhance the codebase of Stdlib to include Boolean Array.

After that, I started figuring the best way to express my idea in proposal for the project. I gone through the entire codebase and check which package I need to update and which package I need to add for fully inclusion of Boolean Array. I have figured it out in time period of 3 weeks. Now, I have content which I have to include in the proposal but still I have to represent in a best way and soon I got to know about LaTex. I learn some basics of LaTex and started building my proposal. Finally, I have completed my proposal and submit it on GSoC dashboard.

There was around almost one month gap between proposal submission deadline and accepted GSoC contributor projects announcement. Though I already decided that, if I will not get accepted for the GSoC then also I complete my project and also contribute it in future. Finally, the day came and Google announced the accepted GSoC contributor and my proposal get accepted.

That day was one of the best day of my life. Sadly, after 2 days I have my end semester examination and hence, I didn't celebrate much and continued my preparation for the exam.
