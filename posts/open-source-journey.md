Hello, I am **Jaysukh Makvana** from Surat, Gujarat. I am pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur.

# Background

Like all other people of engineering background, I am also trying to get some internship from where I can learn something about the real world application of technologies which I have learnt so far. Hence, I was applying to almost every opportunities which I got through any of the platform. But, I wasn't able to grab any of this opportunities. In some companies I rejected in interview and in some companies I didn't get chance to the online assessment round even.

# How I get into Open Source ?

Due to these reasons I started exploring different fields in which I can learn or do anything. And one day, I came across to the word: `"Open Source"`. At that moment, This word fascinates me because it was something in which I can contribute to some real world projects and I can learn many new things. So at this point of time, I decided that I will start contrinuting into open source project but I don't have answer of where, how and what to contribute.

To get answer of these questions, I went to my senior [Pranav Goswami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranavgoswami1/) who are at that time contributing to project LFortran. I discussed about the various aspects of the open source and get solution to almost all my doubts. But still I am left with the question which project to contribute? He knows that, I am good at competitive programming and at that time I learnt Javascript and that's why he suggest me to contribute to the project: [Stdlib](https://stdlib.io/) which is a standard library with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.

# Way to First PR

I started contributing to this project in December 2023. I opened official repository of Stdlib and go through all the steps of setting up project locally. And once, I set up the project I opened Gitter which is chat app similar to Slack for Stdlib. I introduced myself over there and I ask for some good first issue from where I can start. I got replied from the one of the mentor of Stdlib and I got my first issue which was pretty straight forward and Finally, opened my first PR.
